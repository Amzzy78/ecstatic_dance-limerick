           transition into a Freeform dance journey.<br>

          At the end of the set we close with a sound healing meditation to complete the experience.</p>
        <h3 class="dance">On the Dance Floor</h3>
        <p>People of all walks of life, shapes and sizes are welcome to dance however they please. We ask that all
          honour the shared space and one another.</p><br>

        <h3 class="dance">Main Guidelines</h3>

        <p>Barefoot or socks</p>
        <p>No talking on the dance floor</p>
        <p>Honour the no drugs/substances/alcohol policy</p>
        <p>Do not take pictures or video of the dance floor or other participants</p>
        <br>

        <h4>These core guidelines are what keeps the ecstatic dance floor an intentional,
          sacred, and safe space for you to dive deep into the experience.</h4>

        <p>Ecstatic Dance is FreeForm movement—without verbal guidance—to dance in whatever ways feel good to you.
          Dancing solo or with partners is equally welcome.</p>
        <p>Ecstatic Dance is an intentional musical journey mixed by a live DJ.</p>
        <p>Each dance includes a period of gentle warm-up, peaks of ecstatic intensity, and resolves into peaceful
          stillness.</p>
        <p>The music of Ecstatic Dance is characterized by the meeting of Conscious Dance with various Electronic,
          Mantra and World Music Genres.
        </p>
        <p>Ecstatic Dance is held in an inspiring temple-like space with enough room for a critical mass of people
          (50-100).
        </p>
        <p>Ecstatic Dance seeks to build community connection in many ways, including circling together at the closing
          of the dance.
        </p>
        <p>Ecstatic Dance is held to support a safe, healthy, clear-minded space (No alcohol or illegal drugs; everyone
          is expected to move with awareness & care & respect; no scents; no shoes except as needed for medical
          reasons).
        </p>
        <p>Ecstatic Dance is held free of social distractions (no conversations, no cell phones, no photography, no
          videos).
        </p>
