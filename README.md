Welcome to Ecstatic Dance Limerick's Website,

A website for a weekly event based in Limerick, Ireland. The site will feature the event details, guidelines and contact us pages. The website features two videos that have no sound but are to portray the essence of an Ecstatic Dance event, where silence is also part of the dance. Images throughout the site to show the diversity and inclusive nature of the event. 
A guidelines page to explain what is required at these events, such as a code of conduct to adhere to, and a connect page with subscribe functions.
A clear nav bar with 3 pages and footer with important links(safety, guidelines,contact us, privacy policy). 

It is a fully resonsive site. The primary goal of the website is to promote an Ecstatic Dance event in Limerick city at the Killmurry Arts and Community center, and be a online presence like a virtual poster with regular updating of information about the weekly event. The site will be targeted toward building a community of locals looking to express themselves through a free-form dance movement. It will be a space for people wishing to connect with a conscious dancing community that is outside of the regular dance/club scene in Ireland.

Potential customers should be making first contact with the website via the event page.

Implementing

Wireframe Mockups:

First Mockup
After talking with my tutor on the first draught, there were some issues she spotted that I had not considered when on a mobile phone device.
The initial mockup idea would not translate well on a mobile device as the planned layout for the nav bar I wanted for the Ecstatic Dance Limerick would not translate well when on a mobile. It would be too many words in the header fighting for space. Modified to suit by playing with letter-spacing and margins left/right.

Logo image:
# ![Image of svg logo] (../assets/images/logo1-01.svg)
# ![Image of logo jpg] (../assets/images/geometric_logo.png)


The logo I wanted to use was an SVG and this took alot of trying to write the correct css and finding the correct placement.

SVG Logo image was not loading on desktop running firefox and also I could not set the image exactly where I wanted it.Trouble shooting to fix the problem. Experimented with inline and using svg as an img, as an object, and nothing seemed to fix the problem. Finally settled on using as a background image on the hero section. Then the text-tagline in the hero was out of alignment with the logo and this took some time to get right.

I settled on a jpg of the logo and it works right across all browsers.

The Subscribe button and footer banner and navbar stopped being responsive and troubleshooting to figure out what went gone wrong with my media queries and inputs. This I spent alot of time trying to fix to the point that I cut the whole code out and rebuilt it again.

Accessibility:
I did not get to solve all the accessibility issues. Color contrast was an issue and I styled the header and footer darker to fix the color. There is more work to be done to get 100%.
