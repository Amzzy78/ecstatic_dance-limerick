# ![Ecstatic Dance Limerick Logo]()

Welcome to Ecstatic Dance Limerick Website,

Ecstatic Dance Limerick is a site that hopes to promote an Ecstatic Dance event taking place weekly in Limerick at the Killmurry Arts and Community center. The site will be targeted toward building a community of locals looking to express themselves through a free-form dance movement. It will be a space for people wishing to connect with a conscious dancing community that is outside of the regular dance/club scene in Ireland.

Features:
The site will need to feature the event details, guidelines and connect pages.

Existing Features
Navigation Bar

Featured on all three pages, the full responsive navigation bar includes links to the Logo, Home page, Guidelines and Connect page and is identical in each page to allow for easy navigation.
This section will allow the user to easily navigate from page to page across all devices without having to revert back to the previous page via the ‘back’ button.

First Mockup:
The initial mockup idea would not translate well on a mobile device as I had planned on putting Ecstatic Dance Limerick in text as a clickable landing page link on the left side of the header with the logo central and nav links to the right.This would mean that when on a mobile device the text link would be broken up looking and this would be too messy and not inline with good design practice. Nor the look I want to achieve. I will modify the mockup to translate correctly across all devices.

SVG Logo image not loading on desktop running firefox and also I could not set the image exactly where I wanted it.Trouble shooting to fix the problem. Experimented with inline and using svg as an img, as an object, and nothing seemed to fix the problem. Finally settled on using as a background image on the hero section. Then the text-tagline in the hero was out of alignment with the logo and this took some time to get right and I am not happy with where the p text is sitting in the section but for now it will do so I can move on. Also in the future I would like to animate the image logo.

Validating code.

The landing page image:

The landing includes a photograph with text overlay to allow the user to see exactly which location this site would be applicable to.
This section introduces the user to Ecstatic Dance Limerick with an eye catching animation to grab their attention.

Event information section:

The Event information section will allow the user to see the benefits of joining an Ecstatic Dance event, as well as a brief history of the movement.
This user will see the value of attending an Ecstatic Dance event. This should encourage the user to consider dancing as a form of stress relief, meditation and fun.

## Gitpod Reminders

To run a frontend (HTML, CSS, Javascript only) application in Gitpod, in the terminal, type:

`python3 -m http.server`

A blue button should appear to click: _Make Public_,

Another blue button should appear to click: _Open Browser_.

To run a backend Python file, type `python3 app.py`, if your Python file is named `app.py` of course.

A blue button should appear to click: _Make Public_,

Another blue button should appear to click: _Open Browser_.

In Gitpod you have superuser security privileges by default. Therefore you do not need to use the `sudo` (superuser do) command in the bash terminal in any of the lessons.

To log into the Heroku toolbelt CLI:

1. Log in to your Heroku account and go to *Account Settings* in the menu under your avatar.
2. Scroll down to the *API Key* and click *Reveal*
3. Copy the key
4. In Gitpod, from the terminal, run `heroku_config`
5. Paste in your API key when asked

You can now use the `heroku` CLI program - try running `heroku apps` to confirm it works. This API key is unique and private to you so do not share it. If you accidently make it public then you can create a new one with _Regenerate API Key_.

## Updates Since The Instructional Video

We continually tweak and adjust this template to help give you the best experience. Here is the version history:

**May 10 2021:** Added `heroku_config` script to allow Heroku API key to be stored as an environment variable.

**April 7 2021:** Upgraded the template for VS Code instead of Theia.

**October 21 2020:** Versions of the HTMLHint, Prettier, Bootstrap4 CDN and Auto Close extensions updated. The Python extension needs to stay the same version for now.

**October 08 2020:** Additional large Gitpod files (`core.mongo*` and `core.python*`) are now hidden in the Explorer, and have been added to the `.gitignore` by default.

**September 22 2020:** Gitpod occasionally creates large `core.Microsoft` files. These are now hidden in the Explorer. A `.gitignore` file has been created to make sure these files will not be committed, along with other common files.

**April 16 2020:** The template now automatically installs MySQL instead of relying on the Gitpod MySQL image. The message about a Python linter not being installed has been dealt with, and the set-up files are now hidden in the Gitpod file explorer.

**April 13 2020:** Added the _Prettier_ code beautifier extension instead of the code formatter built-in to Gitpod.

**February 2020:** The initialisation files now _do not_ auto-delete. They will remain in your project. You can safely ignore them. They just make sure that your workspace is configured correctly each time you open it. It will also prevent the Gitpod configuration popup from appearing.

**December 2019:** Added Eventyret's Bootstrap 4 extension. Type `!bscdn` in a HTML file to add the Bootstrap boilerplate. Check out the <a href="https://github.com/Eventyret/vscode-bcdn" target="_blank">README.md file at the official repo</a> for more options.

Happy coding!
