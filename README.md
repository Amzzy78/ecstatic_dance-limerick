--Description--

Welcome to Ecstatic Dance Limerick Website,

A website for a weekly event based in Limerick, Ireland. The website features two videos that have no sound but are to portray the essence of an Ecstatic Dance event, where silence is also part of the dance. Images throughout the site to show the diversity and inclusive nature of the event. 
A guidelines page to explain what is required at these events, such as a code of conduct to adhere to, and a connect page with subscribe functions.
A clear nav bar with 3 pages and footer with important links(safety, guidelines,contact us, privacy policy). 

It is a fully resonsive site. The primary goal of the website is to promote an Ecstatic Dance event in Limerick city at the Killmurry Arts and Community center, and be a online presence like a virtual poster with regular updating of information about the weekly event. The site will be targeted toward building a community of locals looking to express themselves through a free-form dance movement. It will be a space for people wishing to connect with a conscious dancing community that is outside of the regular dance/club scene in Ireland.

Potential customers should be making first contact with the website via the event page.

Existing Features

Navigation Bar
# ![Image of navbar] (../assets/images/nav-bar.jpg)

Featured on all three pages, the fully responsive website has a navigation bar which includes links to the text Logo, Event page(home), Guidelines and Connect page(contact us) and is identical in each page to allow for easy of navigation.

First Mockup:
The initial mockup idea would not translate well on a mobile device as I had planned on putting Ecstatic Dance Limerick in text as a clickable landing page link on the left side of the header with the logo central and nav links to the right.This would mean that when on a mobile device the text link would be broken up looking and this would be too messy and not inline with good design practice. I will modify the mockup to translate correctly across all devices.

SVG Logo image not loading on desktop running firefox and also I could not set the image exactly where I wanted it.Trouble shooting to fix the problem. Experimented with inline and using svg as an img, as an object, and nothing seemed to fix the problem. Finally settled on using as a background image on the hero section. Then the text-tagline in the hero was out of alignment with the logo and this took some time to get right and I am not happy with where the p text is sitting in the section but for now it will do so I can move on. Also in the future I would like to animate the image logo.

Validating code. 

Subscribe button and footer banner have stopped working when I opened the workspace today and troubleshooting to figure out what has gone wrong.

## Gitpod Reminders

To run a frontend (HTML, CSS, Javascript only) application in Gitpod, in the terminal, type:

`python3 -m http.server`

A blue button should appear to click: _Make Public_,

Another blue button should appear to click: _Open Browser_.

To run a backend Python file, type `python3 app.py`, if your Python file is named `app.py` of course.

A blue button should appear to click: _Make Public_,

Another blue button should appear to click: _Open Browser_.

In Gitpod you have superuser security privileges by default. Therefore you do not need to use the `sudo` (superuser do) command in the bash terminal in any of the lessons.

To log into the Heroku toolbelt CLI:

1. Log in to your Heroku account and go to *Account Settings* in the menu under your avatar.
2. Scroll down to the *API Key* and click *Reveal*
3. Copy the key
4. In Gitpod, from the terminal, run `heroku_config`
5. Paste in your API key when asked

You can now use the `heroku` CLI program - try running `heroku apps` to confirm it works. This API key is unique and private to you so do not share it. If you accidently make it public then you can create a new one with _Regenerate API Key_.

## Updates Since The Instructional Video

We continually tweak and adjust this template to help give you the best experience. Here is the version history:

**May 10 2021:** Added `heroku_config` script to allow Heroku API key to be stored as an environment variable.

**April 7 2021:** Upgraded the template for VS Code instead of Theia.

**October 21 2020:** Versions of the HTMLHint, Prettier, Bootstrap4 CDN and Auto Close extensions updated. The Python extension needs to stay the same version for now.

**October 08 2020:** Additional large Gitpod files (`core.mongo*` and `core.python*`) are now hidden in the Explorer, and have been added to the `.gitignore` by default.

**September 22 2020:** Gitpod occasionally creates large `core.Microsoft` files. These are now hidden in the Explorer. A `.gitignore` file has been created to make sure these files will not be committed, along with other common files.

**April 16 2020:** The template now automatically installs MySQL instead of relying on the Gitpod MySQL image. The message about a Python linter not being installed has been dealt with, and the set-up files are now hidden in the Gitpod file explorer.

**April 13 2020:** Added the _Prettier_ code beautifier extension instead of the code formatter built-in to Gitpod.

**February 2020:** The initialisation files now _do not_ auto-delete. They will remain in your project. You can safely ignore them. They just make sure that your workspace is configured correctly each time you open it. It will also prevent the Gitpod configuration popup from appearing.

**December 2019:** Added Eventyret's Bootstrap 4 extension. Type `!bscdn` in a HTML file to add the Bootstrap boilerplate. Check out the <a href="https://github.com/Eventyret/vscode-bcdn" target="_blank">README.md file at the official repo</a> for more options.

Happy coding!
