# Ecstatic Dance Limerick
Welcome! https://amzzy78.github.io/ecstatic_dance-limerick/

Ecstatic Dance Limerick website is to be a digital poster for a weekly event based in Limerick, Ireland. The site will feature the event details, guidelines and contact pages in the nav bar. The footer will have links to the connect, guidelines, safety, and privacy policy pages. The website features two videos that have no sound but are to portray the essence of an Ecstatic Dance event, where silence is also part of the dance. Images throughout the site show the diversity and inclusive nature of the event.
The guideline's page will explain what is required at these events, such as a code of conduct to adhere to, and a connect page with a subscribe form.

It is a fully responsive site. The site will be targeted toward building a community of locals looking to express themselves through the freeform dance movement and will be a space for people wishing to connect with a conscious dancing community that is outside of the regular dance/club scene in Ireland.

## Design
--------------
 ### Colour palette:
 The initial colours I chose for both the text and background caused accessability issues. I would have been better off to initially choose a complete colour palette with the correct contrasts for accessability.

 ### Typography:
 Source-sans-pro
 ### Imagery:
 Images and video throughout the site are relative to an Ecstatic Dance event.

## Testing

 ### Lighthouse metrics:
 The performance score and accessibity score were too low and this took time to correct following suggestions from the app. The main issue was the Largest Contentful Paint score and contrast issues.
